<h2>Invitation to the International Workshop on Theory of Submanifolds 2019</h2>
It is my honor and pleasure to invite you to attend International Workshop on Theory of Submanifolds 2019 in Istanbul, Turkey. Istanbul, with its millennial history, has always been a warm and welcoming city. Besides being a great tourist destination between Europe and Asia, it is also a dynamic city, with several hi-tech companies and R&D centers, a fantastic place for congresses and conventions, as well as a great cultural place.
<br /><br />
Together with the Organizing Committee, we are giving our best to ensure a rich and diverse program. We wish to have the pleasure to meet you here in 2019.
<br /><br />
This workshop will take place at Faculty of Science and Letters, Istanbul Technical University, Turkey between August 10-20, 2019. 

The previous conferences <a href="iwts2016.html">“International Workshop on Theory of Submanifolds”</a> in 2016 and <a href="iwfts2014.html">“International Workshop on Finite Type Submanifolds"</a> in 2014 had several participants from different countries. The aim of this meeting is to bring together mathematicians in differential geometry and its applications, to give talks or posters on new results. We would be pleased to see you in Istanbul.
<br /><br />
<b>Nurettin Cenk Turgay, PhD, Associate Professor of Mathematics, General Chair.</b>
